# MiniMax H3 — Development Handoff

Last updated: 2026-09-21

This document is the quick-start handoff for a new ChatGPT conversation. For detailed evolving decisions and heuristics, also read `docs/PROJECT_NOTES.md`.

## Working arrangement

Active development is being handed to ChatGPT in normal chat mode.

Loop:

1. User runs the program locally.
2. User sends logs / acceptance artifacts.
3. ChatGPT inspects the latest `gpt-test-branch` code and the observed failure.
4. ChatGPT makes the smallest generic fix at the actual failing boundary.
5. ChatGPT commits directly to `gpt-test-branch`.
6. User pulls and reruns.

Do not default to Codex prompts. Minimize cognitive load for the user.

### Scheduled H3 iteration

The hourly `H3 Iteration` task should target the currently active GPT-Driven H3 conversation. Each run must read this handoff before acting and update it whenever substantive project state, decisions, or the next acceptance target changes.

Repository: `blanchetteje-hub/MiniMaxH3_Director`

Active branch: `gpt-test-branch`

Always read the current GitHub branch head; do not trust a stale SHA in this document.

## Ultimate goal

The goal is not to preserve any current architecture.

The goal is:

> The user supplies one story (plus whatever minimal explicit input format/reference images prove necessary), and the system reliably creates the proper MiniMax H3 prompts to render that story well.

Story format, story arc generation, whether an arc exists at all, beat generation, Director structure, continuity representation, and deterministic plumbing are all changeable if evidence shows a better structure is required.

KISS is the default, not a prohibition against real architectural correction.

## Current semantic architecture

Current source of truth uses two semantic planning loops:

### ARC

CREATE -> VALIDATE -> REPAIR -> VALIDATE until valid

### BEATS

CREATE -> VALIDATE -> REPAIR -> VALIDATE until valid

Do not add independent semantic enrichment/review/coverage/claims/effect-proof/state-preparation pipelines unless empirical evidence shows the two-loop architecture itself is insufficient.

State is Python-owned canonical data.

`state_effects` live in story-arc `required_events` and are committed by Python only after a beat validates.

The proven single-beat validator is frozen in principle unless new evidence implicates it:

- Mistral 24B
- temperature 0
- repeat_penalty 1.15
- seed 42
- 400/400 benchmark

## Director

### Request 1 — imagination

Expands CURRENT BEAT into a timed raw scene.

It owns beat completion.

Required structural output includes timed actions and exactly one trailing `End continuity state:`.

### Request 2 — stenographer

Translates Request 1 into H3 format.

It must preserve actions, action order, timestamps, camera movement, and dialogue. It must not become a creative rewriting stage.

## Gold acceptance target

The first locked end-to-end benchmark is:

`tests/acceptance/gold/amy_zombie_house.json`

It contains the user's hand-authored 8-segment Amy/zombie story with gold H3 prompts, must-happen constraints, must-not-happen constraints, and expected end states.

GPT-5.6 Sol is the fuzzy semantic evaluator. Do not attempt to replace that final judgment with a 24B local grading model.

The benchmark is behavioral. Generated prompts do not need to match gold strings exactly.

### Acceptance runner

Run locally after pulling:

`python tests/acceptance/run_acceptance.py --image1 amy.jpg`

The runner:

- executes in an isolated temporary repo copy;
- writes the locked Amy story and base subject definitions there;
- removes stale arc/beat/runtime state in the isolated copy;
- runs 8 x 8-second prompt-only segments;
- schedules segment 7 as refresh;
- never sends anything to ComfyUI;
- captures final generated H3 prompts and runtime state;
- writes `acceptance_run.json`, `run.log`, and generated artifacts under `tests/acceptance/results/`.

The user should normally upload `acceptance_run.json` first. Ask for `run.log` when diagnosis needs the LLM exchange/trace.

The runner intentionally produces no semantic pass/fail score. It does perform deterministic capture validation: all eight H3 prompts must be present. A structurally incomplete capture exits nonzero even if `minimax.py` returned best-effort success.

## Gold H3 formatting discoveries

Treat these as tested production heuristics, not arbitrary style preferences:

- Canonical timestamp syntax: `At mm:ss.nnn,`
- Do not append the word `seconds`.
- One discrete action per timestamp.
- No arbitrary timestamp-count limitation.
- `(S#)` is needed only for dialogue speakers.
- Prefer names over pronouns when ambiguity is possible.
- Pronouns are fine within a sentence when the referent is already unmistakable.
- Every append music field should begin `continues from <Video 1>.` before describing a music change.
- Avoid ending an append segment on dialogue when practical; H3 may carry vocal momentum into the next clip.
- If append context does not visibly prove a persistent detail, restate it. This is especially important for full clothing, lower-body clothing, holsters, weapons, injuries, blood, and substances.
- Difficult decapitation/dismemberment works better when staged across separate timed events: strike, separation, detached part movement, reaction/close-up, remaining body collapse.
- For fades, distinguish semantic pre-fade state from the literal black final frame.
- Visually similar characters may require explicit appearance/clothing reinforcement in the opening description.

## Append workflow

Implemented on `gpt-test-branch`:

- only the final 22 frames of the previous video are loaded;
- `skip_first_frames` selects that tail;
- `frame_load_cap = 22` prevents accidental extra context.

Do not revert this to the old 72-frame / 3-second behavior.

## Refresh workflow

The user's tested Extend Backport refresh graph is integrated on `gpt-test-branch`.

Runtime behavior:

- load the previous segment directly;
- calculate its exact H3-aligned frame count from the configured segment length;
- load only the final 22 frames;
- VAE-encode those frames as `context_latent`;
- `context_frames = 7`;
- pass prior video audio as `ref_audio`;
- reverse/select the tail frame using the user's tested first-frame selector path;
- batch active reference images densely and remap render-only `<Picture N>` tags when missing/excluded references require compaction.

For 8-second segments, H3 frame count is 192 and the loader skips 170 frames.

The old `MiniMaxH3HybridRefAndKeyframe` graph is preserved as `Minimax_auto_repair_API.json` and is used only by `--repair`, so the refresh migration does not remove two-keyframe repair behavior.

## Subject input rule

User-defined named Subjects may be declared without a Picture reference, e.g. `<Subject 2> is Will, a 10-year-old boy.`. These are stable Python-owned identities with no initial reference image. Do not force every named character to have `<Picture N>`.

## Continuity philosophy

Principle:

> Know more internally; expose only current final-frame facts.

Persistent Subject identity belongs to Python.

Continuity LLMs cannot create durable Subject identities.

Generic/transient actors cannot collapse into existing named Subjects.

Never special-case literal zombie/weapon/room/character vocabulary in production logic.

## Known environment-continuity action item

Leaving and later re-entering a room can cause H3 to regenerate a different room.

Preferred first attempt later:

- persistent room identity: layout, furniture, doors/windows, colors, major objects;
- mutable room state: damage, broken glass, blood, bodies, moved objects, fire, etc.;
- re-inject that state when the room is revisited.

If descriptive state is insufficient, upgrade to capturing a representative room frame and using it as a reference image on re-entry.

Do not implement this until the gold benchmark exposes it as a priority.

## Significant recent branch work

- Request-1 structural enforcement: timed micro-beat + exactly one non-empty trailing End continuity state.
- Phase-1 final-frame authority separated from full-segment supporting context.
- LLM-emitted Subject identity metadata stripped before mutable continuity validation; Python remains identity authority.
- Append input reduced to final 22 frames and capped at 22.
- Gold 8-beat Amy benchmark locked.
- Acceptance-runner scaffold added.

See Git history for current commit IDs; branch head is authoritative.

## How to work the next failure

When a new acceptance run arrives:

1. Compare each generated H3 prompt to its gold beat behaviorally.
2. Identify the earliest meaningful divergence.
3. Trace the divergence backward:
   - source story / required input format;
   - story arc;
   - beat generation;
   - Request 1;
   - Request 2;
   - continuity Phase 1;
   - Phase 2 projection/opening;
   - identity registry;
   - deterministic Python plumbing.
4. Fix the earliest incorrect boundary rather than patching downstream prose.
5. Add a targeted regression test when deterministic behavior is involved.
6. Commit to `gpt-test-branch`.
7. User pulls and reruns the same locked benchmark.

The benchmark is the finish line. Do not move the gold target simply because production output misses it unless the gold itself is demonstrably wrong.

## Local llama.cpp access

Use tools/chatgpt_llama_bridge.py rather than exposing llama.cpp to the public Internet.

Mailbox branch: gpt-runtime.

The local worker polls ChatGPT-authored JSON jobs, calls the configured local llama.cpp OpenAI-compatible API, then commits responses and requested artifacts back to the mailbox branch.

Normal command:

    python tools/chatgpt_llama_bridge.py

Default endpoint is http://127.0.0.1:8080; override with --endpoint.

This is intentionally not a remote-shell bridge. Supported job kinds are constrained to model chat calls and file collection.

## Current acceptance finding

The original missing-breakfast ARC failure is fixed. Acceptance `run-acceptance-amy-current-061` exposed that the first focused majority implementation was still too coarse.

### Acceptance 061: whole-phase evidence was insufficient

The accepted 061 ARC was:

- Beats 1-2: breakfast / zombie breach
- Beats 3-4: kids to basement / retrieve weapons
- Beat 5: equip weapons
- Beats 6-8: zombie conflict, with Beat 8 also containing immediate resolution

The source explicitly says the **majority** of the film is Amy killing zombies, but only Beats 6-8 materially belonged to that sequence: **3/8**.

The first focused majority validator classified whole phases. Because Beat 5 (pre-conflict equipping) shared Phase 3 with combat, Mistral incorrectly returned the entire Phase 3 as qualifying. Python then counted 4/8 based on the bad semantic evidence. Whole-phase semantic classification is therefore retired for majority counting.

### Current majority design: exact beat evidence inside ARC VALIDATE

Production commit `52bc9dfe191bd2bada77336b27ae3e3716266213` changes the focused semantic judgment from whole-phase evidence to exact beat evidence:

- Mistral sees the source plus every ARC required_event keyed by its Python-owned beat number.
- It classifies each beat independently as belonging or not belonging to the already-active emphasized sequence.
- Standalone setup, escape, retrieval, equipping, travel, or preparation **before** the emphasized process begins does not count.
- A terminal emphasized action still counts when the same beat also contains immediate aftermath/resolution.
- Attacks, counterattacks, reversals, setbacks, weapon transitions after the process begins, continued action, and terminal results may count when they materially continue the emphasized sequence.
- Python only validates the returned beat numbers and counts them. More than half of total beats is required.
- If under-allocated, normal ARC REPAIR runs. This remains inside the ARC CREATE -> VALIDATE -> REPAIR loop; there is no new planning/enrichment subsystem.

Direct probes against the exact 061 ARC:

- `arc-majority-061-beat-evidence-probe-062`: correctly rejected preparation but was too conservative and returned [6, 7], omitting the terminal mixed Beat 8.
- `arc-majority-061-beat-evidence-terminal-probe-063`: after explicitly defining terminal-action handling, returned **[6, 7, 8]**, which is the desired semantic classification for the bad ARC.

Regression contract `df73bab734c7c2ed065c0d037e2d334403f54198` covers both under-allocation (3/8 rejects) and strict-majority allocation (5/8 accepts).

`current-regressions-064`: **PASS, 103/103 tests green**.

### Verification now in progress

- `run-acceptance-amy-current-065`: queued/running against the per-beat majority implementation.
- First check: the accepted ARC must contain at least 5/8 beats that the focused per-beat validator classifies as materially inside the emphasized zombie-conflict sequence.
- If that holds, re-evaluate from Segment 1 and identify the next earliest behavioral divergence.

### Other known semantic probes

Two direct Mistral weaknesses remain observed but are not currently the earliest acceptance boundary:

- `arc-optional-state-effect-strong-probe-053`: even with explicit instructions, Mistral accepted an unsupported inferred Hungry state from cooking.
- `beat-lock-omission-current-probe-055` and `beat-lock-omission-strong-probe-056`: Mistral accepted rushing the children into the basement as completing a job that also required locking the door.

Do not add separate semantic subsystems merely to address these probes. Work them when end-to-end acceptance evidence makes one the earliest failure.

### Downstream note from 061

Segment 1 improved substantially compared with 058: Request 1 visibly turned off the stove, served breakfast to both children, and completed the ordinary domestic scene. So the earlier thin-breakfast concern is no longer the obvious first downstream failure.

Always re-read the current `gpt-test-branch` head, this handoff, and newest `gpt-runtime` results before acting.
